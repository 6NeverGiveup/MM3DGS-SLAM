## Framework

![overview](./static/images/framework.jpg)

As shown above, we present the framework for Multi-modal 3D Gaussian Splatting for SLAM. We utilize inertial measurements, RGB images, and depth measurements to create a SLAM method using 3D Gaussians. Through the effort of integrating multiple modalities, our SLAM method performs with high tracking and mapping accuracy.
